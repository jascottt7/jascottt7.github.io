      <p>Working on his own time and under his own ambition Jason Scott has learned how to code Rails apps. Check out his <a href=https://github.com/jascottt7/>GitHub Account</a> there are some examples of projects that he has worked on.</p>
  <p>After working with Ruby on Rails for a while he decided to create a <a href=https://opensourcecoach.herokuapp.com/>site for Hockey Coaches</a> While working on this project Jason discovered that he struggled with JavaScript. So instead of giving up on his dream of becomming the worlds best developer, he is currently putting a lot of effort into converting the site to a strickly JavaScript site using FireBase you can check that project out <a href=https://personalpage-251dd.firebaseapp.com/add_drill.html>here</a></p>
    </li>

      <h3>He got the Experience</h3>
      <p>This guy has been around the block. He has worked in Telecom, Support, Network Admistration and as a Developer for a wide variety of companies.</p>
      <p>Jason can do it all. From his humble beginings as a Telecom tech to working with non-profits in Northern Africa. He has worked for a startup and a government organization and currently working in the Health Care sector. If you have dreamt it Jason has done it.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     
      <h3>He got the Drive</h3>
      <p>Who can wake up at 6am, get three kids out the door for school, get to work solve issues all day long, come home take the kids to swim practice, coach a hockey or lacrosse game and still have time to learn new skils. You guessed it Jason can. He will figure it out and this takes drive an motivation. There is nobody that will work harder and get it all done like Jason does. This is they guy that you want on your team.</p>

      <h3>He got it All</h3>
      <p>Is there anything that has been missed. Not sure. We spoke about his development skills his vast experience and his drive. </p>
      <p>Oh there may be one little thing left called passion. Jason has it. </p>
      <p>from his early days hacking on his Commodore  64, to spending hours at his cousins house playing with thier Apple II computer, to going to college and switching majors after taking his first programming class in C. Jason was born to be a developer.</p>
      <p> A few years ago he made a decision to focus his attention on learning everything he could about developing and at that time fell in love with Ruby. After working on learning Ruby on Rails and devoping a few applications he discovered that JavaScript was popping up more often. Sick of copying and pasting JavaScript code he is now spending time learning JavaScript</p>
